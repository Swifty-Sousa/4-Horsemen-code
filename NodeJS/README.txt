Describe the repo organization
1)NodeJS folder is the meat of this program. It contains
the views(HTML files for the pages.) Along with
the front end and back end javascript. Along with the
queries in the DAL folder inside NODEJS.
This folder also holds the information for login. Mainly
in the middleware. Then holds the server connection for each
page through the routes folder. Then the SQL folder just
holds example sql code. Lastly, sequelize folder connects
the database.

Of course the app.js runs the server.

The html file in the repo is just the same as views. I uploaded it
first incase anyone wanted to add to them  since
i created them.

Lastly, is the pie-swiper code. This is all Christans
code for his card swiper and for it to function.
