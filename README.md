This project was created in order to aid the event programs specifically through the Honors College at CU Boulder. 
The current system used to log student information is inefficient and impractical. 
Through this upgraded system, students are more easily tracked when they attend events.
Additionally, students have access to their event history and are suggested future events based on recommendations created by the system.



This repo is the source of all code for our project, the project hieirachy is as follows:

Pie-1-Swiper:
  this is the gui program for taking in student data to signify a student has attended an event. Under the "final folder 
is where the program files are held. In this folder there are two files, gui.py and logic.py. When running the gui only the gui.py 
file needs to be ran, the logical funcions will be pulled in automatically. The files can be run by opening a terminal shell, 
navigating to the folder and typing "python3 gui.py". The file dependancies are python3 and the Tkinter library which usually comes 
standard with python3 builds.
